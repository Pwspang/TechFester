# ChJester 

Innovative solution for effortless Black Box testing. Seamlessly extract, select, and test functions with our automated Jest file generation.

## Inspiration

Tedious to generate testcases during software development cycle. We can leverage on current GAI technologies to generate testcases, complex inputs can be generated using GAI.

## What it does

Goal: To automatically generate testcases and Jest file for blackbox testing.

## How we built it

**Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/) & [Charkra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

**Backend**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) & [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)

**API**: [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

## Challenges we ran into

Prompt Engineering needed to generate more quality results.

Preprocessing steps needed perhaps to accurately extract functions and parameters.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Able to generate jest files to test simple functions such as converting time from 12H format to 24H format. 

## What we learned
Teamwork

The complexities of API integration and blackbox testing.

## What's next for ChJester

Extraction of Function behaviour and variable description can be done automatically through code comments.


Able to generate test case for a project and determine the test coverage.
